# InteractiveComic
My Interactive Comics project is an experimental approach to explore how traditional
paper-based comics can be implemented in digital media. Escaping from the boundaries of the
page and traditional panel compositions, Interactive Comics demonstrates a multi-directional
panel composition, allowing readers’ freedom in the direction they read comics. Readers can
choose their own direction, zoom in and out to see the detail of panels, or use a mouse or touch
based device to navigate. Furthermore, Interactive Comics affords freedom in story progression
in comics. It provides a branched story allowing the view of the story to be changed based on
readers’ choices. Using these two methods to afford the non-linear progression of a story,
Interactive Comics inspires readers to revisit a story to experience different storylines, and
different character perspectives
